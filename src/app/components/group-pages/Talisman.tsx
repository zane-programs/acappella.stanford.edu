        We are Stanford Talisman, a group of singers on Stanford&apos;s campus
        who since our origins have sung music stemming from Black liberation
        struggles across the world. We&apos;ve performed all over the globe, be
        it Hawai&apos;i, South Africa, or Thailand, and in all kinds of
        settings, from White Plaza to the White House. We appreciate the great
        challenge of responsibly engaging with the genuine roots of the songs we
        sing, in their varied languages and cultural contexts, and are committed
        to bringing these songs to life as best as our abilities allow. With us,
        you will find not only music in all its rich history, but also a
        life-long community.
