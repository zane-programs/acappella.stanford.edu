        Our alumni network is a tight-knit community; at our 30 year reunion
        last year, we had members from every single year of the group&apos;s
        existence in attendance. We save the front row of each of our shows for
        alums attending from near and far and invite them up to sing an
        arrangement that has been performed in Harmz since the group&apos;s
        inception in 1991. We strive to create a caring, supportive, and
        inclusive environment that stretches far beyond our love of music.
