        As one of the few collegiate a cappella groups to own a wireless sound
        system, all of our members perform with individual microphones, and our
        explosive performances come with state of the art live dynamic and
        effect mixing. We&apos;ve gained international recognition for our
        inventive take on a diverse array of genres, having been featured on
        Best of College Acapella, Sing, and Voices Only a capella compilations.
        Signal Lost, our most recent album, won the Contemporary A Cappella
        Recording Award for Best Rock Album in 2020.
