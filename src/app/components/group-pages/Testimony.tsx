        Testimony Christian A Cappella is Stanford University&apos;s
        award-winning Christian a cappella group. Now celebrating thirty-four
        years of God-inspired song and its sixth album release, Testimony is the
        original collegiate Christian a cappella group on the west coast,
        comprised of Stanford students dedicated to sharing their music and
        faith with their community, both within the Stanford community and
        internationally. Through year round concerts ranging from performances
        on campus, to local church services, to homeless shelters and soup
        kitchens, and christian conferences across the country, Testimony
        Christian A Cappella seeks to glorify God with the voices He has lent
        us. We sing to many, rejoicing in our audience of one.
