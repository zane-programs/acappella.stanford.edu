        Testimony Christian A Cappella is Stanford University&apos;s
        award-winning Christian a cappella group. Now celebrating thirty-one
        years of God-inspired song and its upcoming sixth album release,
        Testimony is the original collegiate Christian a cappella group on the
        west coast, comprised of Stanford students dedicated to sharing their
        music and faith with their community, both within the Stanford community
        and internationally. Through year round concerts ranging from
        performances in the dining halls, to local church services, to homeless
        shelters and soup kitchens, Testimony Christian A Cappella seeks to
        glorify God with the voices He has lent us. We sing to many, rejoicing
        in our audience of one.
