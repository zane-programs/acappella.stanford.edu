        Dedicated to delivering the finest tunes spanning generations, the
        Mendicants perform a wide range of styles from soulful gospel to radio
        pop. They&apos;ve performed around the world, yet it all began with an
        impromptu gathering at Branner Hall. With just one song rehearsed, they
        broke bread and sang, filling the hall with enchanting melodies. Before
        long, there wasn&apos;t a dry eye in the house. When the final note
        reverberated, the room erupted into a thunderous applause.
        Undergraduates swarmed the astonished Mendicants, yearning for an
        encore. The rest, as they say, is history.
