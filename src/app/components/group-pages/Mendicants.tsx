        The Mendicants are a group of singers devoted to performing the best
        songs of today, yesterday and several decades ago. We pride ourselves on
        our wide range of styles, from gospel and barbershop to original
        compositions, jazz standards and contemporary pop. You can see us on
        stage, serenading in stairwells, or even just breaking out into song
        around campus.

        They say that the group originally rehearsed only one song that they
        performed for the first time one lunchtime in Branner Hall. As they
        sang, the hall rang with beautiful music and soon there wasn&apos;t a
        dry eye in the house. When they finished, there was a tumultuous
        explosion of applause as undergrads threw themselves at the stunned
        Mendicants, clamoring for more. The rest, as they say, is history.
