        The Stanford Fleet Street Singers, or simply &ldquo;Fleet Street,&rdquo;
        was founded in 1981 with barbershop roots. The group is known for
        performing an incredible number of songs entirely written by members of
        the group. Most songs are funny. Really funny, that is. And in case the
        songs aren&apos;t funny, Fleet Street strives to create a multimedia
        experience for audiences with original sketch comedy and short films
        during its shows.

        Examining our repertoire, you will find an arsenal the size of Nebraska
        of jazz classics and sentimental serenades across our 13 published
        albums. Only one song of the 13 albums is a song that we didn&apos;t
        write or arrange ourselves, and we only sing it around Christmas time.
        We pioneered the production of the first major college a cappella album
        comprised entirely of songs written by the performing group in 2004.

        Fleet Street is rooted in the Stanford tradition: bedecked in
        cardinal-red bowties and socks, we remain the only group on campus
        devoted to the preservation of Stanford&apos;s rich history of music. In
        fact, the university recently tapped Fleet Street to be its musical
        ambassadors and to an entire album of classic fight songs in honor of
        Stanford&apos;s centennial.

        Nevertheless, this rowdy bunch perpetuates a legacy of expanding what
        college a cappella means because Fleet Street is certainly not afraid
        of, as the kids say, &ldquo;doing their own thang.&rdquo;
