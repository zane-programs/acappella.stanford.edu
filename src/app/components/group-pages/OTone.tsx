        As Stanford&apos;s newest a cappella group, founded in 2016, we are
        committed to sharing East Asian music and culture to the world through

        We sing a wide variety of styles and genres ranging from traditional
        folk songs to contemporary pop, alternative rock, and R&B â€” primarily in
        Chinese, Korean, and Japanese, but with the occasional English mash-up.
        No language experience is required to audition, though!
