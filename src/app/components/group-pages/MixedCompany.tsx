        College A Cappella and Voices Only compilation CDs, Stanford Mixed
        Company—or Mixed Co—is Stanford&apos;s oldest all-gender acapella group,
        founded in 1985. Widely recognized both on campus and around the
        country, Mixed Co produces a wide variety of music from all genres,
        singing pop, R&B, indie hits, classics, and more. Every year, they put
        on two major concerts: an anti-Valentine&apos;s Day show called Love
        Sucks in February, and their Spring Show in May, as well as performing
        in gigs and shows around campus and the Bay Area.
